# EmergingSysArch
CS 350 Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goal of this project was to write an interface software to control hardware components. We were to look into and analyze the hardwares' architecture design and loook over its application performance. The hardware we are looking at is the global smart thermostat that should connect via Wi-Fi, have capacity for Flash and RAM and support the peripherals used in the project. 

What did you do particularly well?
I would say I did well with comments in my code to keep organized so that it is easy to follow as well as naming conventions. 

Where could you improve?
I would improve my taking my time with code to really understand its purpose instead of "sticking spaghetti to a wall" and cleaning it up afterwards. I find that I've always done that with all projects I've worked on in the past (outside of CS) for school and at work. I think I can improve this not only for schoolwork, but also in my personal life as well. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am definately adding system suport to my network of support. Asing the support pages through forums and the system's website helped me overcome alot of issues. I definately would have saved so much more time if I had just rached out for help in the beginning. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The biggest skill I learned was patience with computer science and software engineering. The job lets us take our time in solving problems, but could easily go downward once a piece of code does not work. I have also learned to be organized and plan out/look over what the requirements are before beginning. I think overall capacity planning and overall planning would help greatly with other projects and/or course work.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this project maintainable, readable and adaptable by keeping everything neat and organized. Each function had its own comments and code was to best practices so that it could be easily understood and replicable.
